<p>One of the classic representatives of the first-person shooter genre. Designed and released in 1996 by the authors of the groundbreaking game Doom - iD Software. This is the first game to start the still ongoing series. Unlike its famous predecessor, the game uses an engine capable of rendering full-fledged 3D: the game supports an earlier version of 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After moving to a new engine, the game needed a new control scheme: the movement is now possible in all three directions, including the vertical axis. This feature added to the game an additional difficulty: player have to expect the enemy attack from any direction. The game also has a full-fledged multiplayer, the previous version of which the Doom players liked.</p>
<h3>Key features</h3>
<p>In a single player campaign, the player takes control of the main character named Ranger, who went to the portal in order to stop the unknown enemies, code-named Quake. The plot of the adventure consists of 32 separate levels. Six more maps are available in multiplayer for the battles between the players for deathmatch mayhem. Two mission packs were released for the game, which adds new enemies, new levels, new maps, new weapons and a new experience for players to the original game. Both packs were greatly received by both players and critics.</p>",94

It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and is a follow-up to the 1992 Game Boy title Wave Race. Most of the game involves the player racing on a Jet Ski on a variety of courses while successfully manoeuvring the vehicle around various buoys. A multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other on a chosen course is also included. The game supports the Controller Pak, which allows players to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.<br />
Originally referred to as &quot;F-Zero on water&quot;, the game was intended to feature high-speed boats with transforming capabilities. However, these were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis as producer Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the game would not be differentiated enough from other titles on other systems. Wave Race 64 received critical acclaim from critics, who praised the game&#39;s satisfying controls and dynamic watery environments. The game is credited for helping Nintendo effectively make its paradigmatic leap from the 16-bit 2D graphics of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64&#39;s 3D capabilities.

You are licensed to kill!,"<p>GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and based on the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.<br />
GoldenEye 007 was developed over a period of two and a half years by an inexperienced team led by Martin Hollis, who had previously worked on the coin-op version of Killer Instinct. It was partially conceived as an on-rails shooter inspired by Sega&#39;s Virtua Cop, before being redesigned as a free-roaming shooter. The game was highly acclaimed by the gaming media and sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. It received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Games Award and four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.<br />
Retrospectively, GoldenEye 007 is considered an important game in the history of first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode. The game is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010.</p>",96

Initially, the game was unsuccessful – particularly in the United States where it was meagerly publicized – but thanks to praise by critics, it gained sales through word-of-mouth and became a hit.

Half-Life has won more than 50 Game of the Year awards from publications around the world, and was named 'Best PC Game Ever' in PC Gamer's November 1999 issue. [Sierra]","<p>Half-Life is the original game in the series. Being a revolutionary at the time, we follow the story of Gordon Freeman - a silent scientist at the facility called Black Mesa.

The laboratory is destroyed as well as the facility itself, as unknown creatures like Vortigaunts are now everywhere in the facility. Gordon must battle his way to the surface and find a way to close the portal.</p>
<p>One of the main features of Half-Life was story-telling through scripted sequences within the actual gameplay. Without having cutscenes, the game was able to tell the full story of the game by showing scripted deaths, dialogues, character appearance while the gameplay was moving one. By not ripping off the player from the process, the game feels much more smooth as it continues. Despite his science nature, Gordon is masterfully using his weapons and destroys any enemy at his path with rifles, grenades, shotguns and much more.</p>",96

The plot was always present, but not so confining as in traditional shooters - there was almost always more than one task to accomplish. Levels were realistically designed and had logical reasons behind them. It is the principle of System Shock 2 to continue this game design.

We are onboard the spaceship Von Braun that returns from humanity&#39;s first interstellar expedition to Tau Ceti system. The plot follows the main character who awakens from the cryosleep, with no idea what&#39;s going on. The rest of the crew was affected by some disaster that either killed them or turned into brainwashed slaves of an alien entity called The Many. The only other survivor is presumed to be mysterious Dr. Janice Polito, who instructs the player via radio. To survive and find out what happened, the protagonist sets out to explore the dimly lit corridors of Von Braun, encountering his former friends mutated into abominations. The player can use guns, but ammunition is scarce, which forces the player to use it prudently and move ahead with caution.</p>
<p>The game was created by Ken Levine, the Irrational Games founder and famous designer behind such titles as BioShock and Thief: The Dark Project.

Final Fantasy IX,PlayStation,PS,9,94,"November 13, 2000","The last Final Fantasy for the PlayStation, Final Fantasy IX returns to the pure fantasy roots that spawned the series.  This latest installment features highly detailed characters, vehicles, and environments, and breathtaking cinema-graphics.  The addition of brand new features such as the story-enhancing Active Time Event system and the return of minigames that grant additional gameplay make Final Fantasy IX not only a memorable gaming experience, but also a significant step forward in the series.","<p>Final Fantasy IX (ファイナルファンタジーIX, Fainaru Fantajī Nain) is a 2000 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation video game console. It is the ninth title in the main Final Fantasy series and the last to debut on the original PlayStation. The game plot centers on the consequences of a war between nations in a medieval fantasy world called Gaia. Players follow bandit Zidane Tribal, who kidnaps Alexandrian princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a gambit by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to take down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war. The plot shifts when the player learns that Brahne is a pawn of a more menacing threat, Kuja, who shares a mysterious history with Zidane spanning two worlds.<br />
The game was developed alongside Final Fantasy VIII. Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by returning to the medieval style of the first six installments. Consequently, it was influenced heavily by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to the rest of the titles. Despite this approach, the game did introduce new features to the series, such as &quot;Active Time Event&quot; cutscenes, &quot;Mognet&quot;, and unique equipment and skill systems.<br />
Final Fantasy IX was released to critical acclaim. It is often cited by critics and fans as one of the best Final Fantasy titles, and holds the highest Metacritic score of the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling more than 5 million copies worldwide by March 2003 and 5.5 million copies by February 2016. It was re-released in 2010 as a PSOne Classic on the PlayStation Store; this version was compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita support arrived in 2012. In 2016, ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.</p>",84

Nobuteru Yūki designed the characters of the game.<br />
The story of Chrono Cross focuses on a teenage boy named Serge and a theme of parallel worlds. Faced with an alternate reality in which he died as a child, Serge endeavors to discover the truth of the two worlds&#39; divergence. The flashy thief Kid and many other characters assist him in his travels around the tropical archipelago El Nido.

Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec,PlayStation 2,PS2,8.5,95,"July 9, 2001","With the addition of two new courses (a downtown Tokyo circuit and the Monte Carlo Grand Prix course), an impressive range of cars (from Vipers to Cooper Minis), and a soundtrack featuring everything from Lenny Kravitz to Jimi Hendrix, this highly anticipated title is finally ready to be driven.","<p>Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec (グランツーリスモ3: A-spec Guran Tsūrisumo Surī A-supekku) is a 2001 racing game, the first in the Gran Turismo series released for the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>The objective of the game is to win all the provided races, championships, complete license tests and achieve 100% game completion. Every 25% of the game completed results in the player being awarded a car as a special prize. For GT3, the Gran Turismo Mode (Simulation Mode in the North American version) has a reorganized layout, with a more structured and progressive arrangement of races and challenges. Races vary from short beginner events to multi-hour endurance races and also rallying events against an opponent. In addition, the car shops are now organized by country and then by manufacturer, which some find to be more intuitive than the East/West City method used in its predecessor.</p>
<p>The Arcade Mode is reorganized in &quot;stages&quot;; these stages are made up of 5 or 6 tracks pooled from all available tracks in the game, including both road and rally races. To get to the next stage, all tracks on a stage must be completed on Easy difficulty or higher. By beating the stage on Normal or Difficult, additional cars are unlocked as well for play in any mode of Arcade Mode (including two-player battle and time trial).</p>
<p>GT3 features 19 race courses, 14 of which have reverse variants&#39; and 4 of which are dirt tracks. Most of these circuits are at fictional locations, but California&#39;s Laguna Seca Raceway and Côte d’Azur (which is heavily based on the Monaco Grand Prix circuit) are not.</p>
<p>Other changes include the omission of the ability to &quot;race modify&quot; or add downforce to production cars, removal of suspension damage, and the absence of torque limits for races.</p>
<p>New to the franchise, GT3 also contained unlicensed versions of six actual Formula One cars, labelled as F686/M, F687/S, F688/S, F090/S, F094/H and F094/S (in the Japanese and American versions) that the player could win from endurance races. In the Japanese and American versions, the name of each car denotes various pieces of information (such as the amount of cylinders in the engine, the year the chassis was raced, and its driver, respectively). For example, the a forementioned F094/S was the 10-cylinder, 1994-season car driven by Ayrton Senna, whereas the F686/M represented the 6-cylinder, 1986-season car driven by Nigel Mansell. In the PAL release, however, there were only two F1 cars, not obviously based on any real-life counterparts and instead labelled as Polyphony 001 and 002 respectively.</p>
<p>GT3 also marks informal appearances of automakers Lamborghini and Porsche. A racing JGTC Lamborghini Diablo was featured in the NTSC-J version (where the car has been cut from NTSC-U copy and being available in NTSC-U copy with a cheat device), and a Porsche 911 GT3 can be found in the game code (though it cannot be obtained normally, and requires the use of a cheat device). Both cars, together with two hidden Lancia Stratoses (road and rally versions), however, are completely absent in PAL version. Lamborghini would make its first official appearance in 2009&#39;s Gran Turismo (PSP), while Porsche made its first official appearance in Gran Turismo Sport for the PlayStation 4.</p>",

Equipped with a Power Beam and Gravity Suit, you must shoot locked switches, solve puzzles, and eliminate enemies. It's up to you to explore the world and recover more power-ups and weapons, which gradually open more gameplay areas.","<p>Metroid Prime is a first-person action-adventure video game developed by Retro Studios and Nintendo for the GameCube video game console. It was released in North America on November 17, 2002, and in Japan and Europe the following year. Metroid Prime is the fifth main installment in the Metroid series, and the first Metroid game to use 3D computer graphics. Because exploration takes precedence over combat, Nintendo classifies the game as a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter. On the same day as its North American release, Nintendo also released the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion, marking the return of the Metroid series after an eight-year hiatus following Super Metroid (1994).<br />
Metroid Prime is the first of the three-part Prime storyline, which takes place between the original Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus. Like previous games in the series, Metroid Prime has a science fiction setting in which players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran. The story follows Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV. The game was a collaboration between Retro&#39;s staff in Austin, Texas, and Japanese Nintendo employees, including producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who suggested the project after visiting Retro&#39;s headquarters in 2000.<br />
The game garnered critical praise and commercial success, selling more than a million units in North America alone. It won a number of Game of the Year awards, and it is considered by many critics and gamers to be one of the greatest video games ever made, remaining one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic. In 2009, an enhanced version was released for the Wii as a standalone game in Japan, and as part of the Metroid Prime Trilogy compilation internationally.</p>",97

Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself. Vice City offers vehicular pleasures to suit every taste. For the speed enthusiast, there's high-performance cars and motorbikes. For the sportsman, a powerboat or a golf buggy lets you enjoy the great outdoors. For those that need that sense of freedom and escape, why not charter a helicopter and see the beauty of Vice City from the air? [Rockstar]","<p>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a third-person shooter with an open world.

GTA: Vice City is a fourth game of the series, following Grand Theft Auto III.</p>
<p>The main character is introduced as Tommy Vercetti, an Italian-American mobster who works for a wealthy crime family.

The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,GameCube,0,9,96,"March 24, 2003","In this ninth entry in the Legend of Zelda series, Link debuts on GameCube with a fun new cel-shaded look, but the game stays true to the respected heritage of the series. The classic mix of sword-swinging action, perplexing puzzles and stirring story lines remains intact, but the stunning cel-shaded graphics give the people and places of Link's watery world a wildly artistic new look. And for the very first time, Link sails freely on the high seas. Join Link on his most epic and scenic adventure yet. Face unimaginable monsters, explore puzzling dungeons, and meet a cast of unforgettable characters as he searches for his kidnapped sister, Aryll.","<p>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube home video game console. The tenth installment in The Legend of Zelda series, it was released in Japan in December 2002, in North America in March 2003, and in Europe in May 2003.<br />
The game is set on a group of islands in a vast sea, a departure for the series. The player controls series protagonist Link as he attempts to save his sister from the sorcerer Ganon and becomes embroiled in a struggle for the Triforce, a sacred relic that grants its holder&#39;s wishes. Aided by allies including pirate captain Tetra – an incarnation of Princess Zelda – and a talking boat named the King of Red Lions, Link sails the ocean, explores islands, and traverses dungeons to acquire the power necessary to defeat Ganon. Wind, which facilitates sailing, plays a prominent role, and can be controlled with a magic conductor&#39;s baton called the Wind Waker.<br />
The Wind Waker was directed by Eiji Aonuma and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It retains the basic 3D gameplay of its predecessors, Ocarina of Time and Majora&#39;s Mask, but with a distinctive cartoon-like art style created through cel shading. The game received widespread critical acclaim, but the art style proved divisive among players, which contributed to comparatively weak sales. As a result, Nintendo changed directions with the next Zelda installment, the more realistically-styled Twilight Princess. However, The Wind Waker&#39;s reputation improved over time, and it is now widely considered one of the greatest video games ever made. The Wind Waker originated the &quot;Toon Link&quot; variant of the main character, and received two direct sequels for the Nintendo DS, Phantom Hourglass (2007) and Spirit Tracks (2009). A high-definition remaster, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD, was released for the Wii U in 2013, to critical acclaim.</p>",

Among the new characters playable in the game are Meta Knight, the sword-wielding nemesis of Kirby; Pit, the angelic archer from Kid Icarus; Zero Suit Samus, the powerful Metroid series heroine minus her versatile armor; and Wario, who demonstrates a noxious attack of gastronomic proportions. Also Snake, the gritty soldier from Konami's hugely popular Metal Gear series. [Nintendo]","<p>Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a crossover platform fighting game for the Nintendo Wii published by Nintendo in 2008 and the third entry in the Super Smash Bros. series. It was developed by an ad hoc development team consisting of staff from Sora Ltd, GAME ARTS, Monolith Soft, HAL Laboratory and Paon.</p>
<p>Like the two precedent instalments, the game features characters, locations and items from various Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda or Kirby. However, Brawl is the first game to include characters from third-party franchises, such as Sonic the Hedgehog or Solid Snake from the Metal Gear series. </p>
<p>The Smash Bros. series is notable among fighting games for its unorthodox gameplay. A game takes place on a stage that could be compared to a platform game level. Instead of a health bar, damage is represented by a percentage. When a player hits another, the victim&#39;s percentage increases. The higher the percentage, the further a player will be knocked away when hit. The goal is to knock other players out of the screen using a varied set of moves. Two to four players can fight at the same time, either in a free-for-all match or a team battle. Special rulesets also allow for different win conditions.</p>
<p>Items randomly appear around the stage and can be picked up and used by fighters to aid in combat. These include food that heals the user, various weapons such as laser swords or firework launchers, or even Pokéballs containing powerful Pokémon. Brawl also introduces Assist Trophies, items that allow one to summon characters from various franchises to fight for them temporarily, as well as Smash Balls, which, when broken, allow a fighter to unleash their ultimate attack on their opponents. The game also supports custom rulesets, allowing players to disable items if they wish.</p>
<p>Brawl is the first game in the series to include a complete single-player story campaign, named the Subspace Emissary. It features all the playable characters in the midst of a conflict against a mysterious entity looking to collect pieces of their world for an unknown reason. The player fights hoards of enemies throughout a multitude of platforming levels. It was also the first game to allow online play with friends or random players. This feature is no longer available due to the discontinuation of the Wii&#39;s online service in May 2014</p>
<p>Super Smash Bros. Brawl was praised by the critic for its fun and easy to learn gameplay, its sheer density and the attention put into the representation of its featured franchises. However, it left many fans of the series, particularly its competitive aspect, disappointed. The changes made to the gameplay from Melee considerably slowed the pace of the game and severe balance issues existed, which resulted in the game&#39;s competitive scene becoming inactive early in its life. To fix these issues, players resorted to modding. Among the various mods that were created was Project M, a mod that, at first, aimed to make Brawl feel more like its predecessor Melee, and later grew to become much more distinct from any game in the series. Project M gathered a decently sized competitive scene to the point where it was played at major tournaments along with the official games, but its development eventually shut down in 2015.</p>
<p>Despite this, Brawl is the eight best-selling game on the Wii, having sold 13.29 million units as of March 2018. It is often considered to be the best Smash Bros. game for casual play or single-player.</p>",93

Super Combo gauge returns for previous games and allows the player to perform more powerful versions of character’s special attacks. The new Ultra Combo system fills a special Ultra Combo gauge with each hit laid on your character and allows you to unleash a string of powerful attacks on the enemy.</p>",91

With Dark Souls II the main director and founder of Souls-like genre Hidetaka Miyazaki took place only as a supervisor of the project, leaving a place of the director of the game for two young video game designers Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura. One could ask if the game is as good and beautiful as other past games in the Series and the answer would be that Dark Souls II is different yet deep and unforgiving as all the other titles in the series. The famous difficulty of previous games is still there but the world is much simpler yet connected and dangerous. Enemies still respond after death of a player but only about 15 times. After that they disappear forever. Boss battles are much simpler, this time focuses on many simpler bosses at a time instead of one powerful boss. <br />

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves.

Every match is an intense multiplayer showdown pitting a diverse cast of soldiers, mercenaries, scientists, adventurers, and oddities against each other in an epic, globe-spanning conflict.","<h3>The Legacy</h3>
<p>Overwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter from the company that gave players the saga of Azeroth, Starcraft and the Diablo universe. Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.</p>
<h3>The story and setting</h3>
<p>Anyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.</p>
<h3>Continuous support</h3>
<p>The game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.</p>",91

It is a part of a large Forza series including 11 titles in it with Horizon 3 being the 9th heading in the row.

As mentioned earlier, the title series does not follow a distinct storyline. Speaking of surroundings, nonetheless, it is safe to say, that the Horizon 3&#39;s scene is an Australia.

Now the protagonist becomes a host of the event, so they must play organizing roles, too. For example, hire drivers and adjust the racing grounds.<br />

Demon's Souls,PlayStation 5,PS5,8,92,"November 11, 2020","From PlayStation Studios and Bluepoint Games comes a remake of the PlayStation classic, Demon’s Souls. Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who’ve faced its trials and tribulations before, can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance. In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One. With the summoning of The Old One, a colorless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them, lost their minds – left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained. Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight, are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title “Slayer of Demons” and send The Old One back to its slumber.","<p>Demon’s Souls is an action RPG, the first installment in the Souls series, known mostly because of the Dark Souls trilogy. Demon’s Souls is also set in a grey-colored dark medieval-themed world that is attacked by the demon fog. You take on the role of a knight that entered the fog trying to save the kingdom from demons. He was eventually killed and reborn, and now needs to travel the entire kingdom to gain power and set the world free.</p>
<p>Your character is fully customizable and can be upgraded with souls you get through battles. Demon’s Souls combat system is quite complicated as you can’t gain experience killing ordinary enemies to defeat the boss later. Here you need to work out unique tactics for every monster type. As a result, the gameplay is quite challenging with frequent deaths.</p>
<p>However, there’s a way to simplify the game a little. Some of your actions, for example, killing or helping NPCs, affect the gameplay. This parameter is called tendency; when it’s white, the enemies are easier and the rewards are fewer. When it’s black, it produces the opposite effect.</p>",89

Steam Workshop integration for easier modding<br />
A lifetime “living” project - created/updated since 2003, with no end in sight<br />
Generate your unique world and manage a bustling colony of dwarves, even as they probably mine towards their eventual demise.<br />

Optional LEGENDS MODE: read the history of the generated world and your games in it<br />
A new endless hobby, just for you!<br />
The legendary Dwarf Fortress is now on Steam! Build a fortress and try to help your dwarves survive, despite threats of starvation, dragons, and madness.<br />
In this complex construction/management/roguelike simulation, every generated world brings a unique challenge, whether it’s dwarves with their own simulated personalities or aquifers. Observe what makes your civilization fall into eventual decline, and learn for next time… until something else inevitably goes wrong.<br />
The combat model includes skills, body parts, material properties, aimed attacks, wrestling, pain, nausea, various poison effects, and much more.<br />
It’s difficult to convey the depth of the generation. Hundreds of animals and monsters, many of which are randomly created for each world, as well as generated poetry, musical forms, instruments, and dances for your dwarves to practice and perform. A dynamic weather model tracks wind, humidity, and air masses to create fronts, clouds, storms, and blizzards. Over two hundred rock and mineral types can appear, in their proper geological environments.<br />
Your purchase includes Dwarf Fortress Classic if you prefer to play without graphics or music or Steam-specific features, in the “classic” beta branch.<br />
Remember: Losing is fun!<br />
Nothing substantial is new or changed, under the hood. It’s still good old Dwarf Fortress, but with graphics support and music by default. A few bells and whistles won’t change that.<br />
You may already be familiar with the tile set mod packs from Michał “Mayday” Madej and Patrick Martin “Meph” Schroeder. They’re collaborating on an all-new, from-scratch tileset, as seen in the trailer and screenshots. Meanwhile, Dabu has composed a few musical tracks, to match the seasons, and some other audio bits and pieces.<br />
Command your dwarves as they search for wealth in their generated mountain. Your dwarves will need a steady supply of food and beer, but they’ll also need your guidance in surviving attacks from hostile civilizations, the wilderness, or even the dead.<br />
Craft treasures and furnitures from various materials<br />
Establish a barony and support the increasingly demanding nobility<br />
Read your dwarves’ thoughts to keep them happy<br />

Recruit people to join you on your journey<br />
Explore without cumbersome plot restrictions, from capitals to catacombs, labyrinths to bandit camps.<br />
The original nemesis system: Meet adversaries from the previous games<br />
Earn a reputation as a hero, soldier, thug, musician, etc, with various civilizations<br />
Stealth system with vision arcs, respecting vegetation density and other factors<br />
Use signs like shoe impressions and animal tracks to hunt and avoid danger<br />
